👋 Hi, I’m @unpronounceablepaul
👀 I’m interested in web development, coding, hacking, and the terrible mean New England Patriots!
🌱 I’m currently learning Github, AWS, HTML/CSS, and a little WordPress.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all of the above and any other interesting ideas.
📫 How to reach me: paulunpronounceable@gmail.com
😄 Pronouns: Why does it have to matter? As they say these days, "You do you...".
⚡ Fun fact: I'm old.
